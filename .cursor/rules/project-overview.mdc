# Cellular Automata Project Overview

This is a generative animated art application featuring various cellular automata algorithms implemented in TypeScript with Vite. The project showcases different types of cellular automata including 1D, 2D, and 3D variants.

## Tech Stack
- **Runtime**: Bun (JavaScript runtime)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: Vanilla JS with Canvas API
- **UI Controls**: Tweakpane
- **Color Management**: Chroma.js
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry
- **Code Quality**: Biome (linting & formatting)

## Key Features
- **Multiple Algorithm Types**: 1D, 2D, and 3D cellular automata
- **Real-time Visualization**: Canvas-based rendering with configurable resolution
- **Color Palettes**: Support for custom color palettes including movie-inspired ones
- **Interactive Controls**: Real-time parameter adjustment via Tweakpane
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to window resizing
- **Route-based Navigation**: URL-based algorithm selection
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry integration for monitoring

## Development Commands
- `bun run dev` - Start development server
- `bun run build` - Build for production
- `bun run preview` - Preview production build
- `bun run check` - Lint and format code with Biome
